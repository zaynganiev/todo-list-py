# 📝 My To-Do App

A simple desktop To-Do List application built with Python and `PySimpleGUI` (used here as `FreeSimpleGUI`). This app allows users to add, edit, and complete tasks, all while keeping track of the current time.

## 💡 Features

- Add new to-dos
- Edit existing to-dos
- Mark to-dos as complete (removes them)
- Real-time clock display
- Saves to-dos in a local `todos.txt` file

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `PySimpleGUI`

Install requirements via pip:

```bash
pip install PySimpleGUI

🚧 This project is complete and no longer being actively developed.
